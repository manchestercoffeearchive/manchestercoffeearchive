_Updated: 08/03/2021_


## Aim

This is an attempt to collate all the currently available information on the topic of “freezing” roasted coffee in order to preserve it for long periods of time. Freezing is the driving force being MCA so it has therefore been crucial that we look into best practices.

I will focus on my own experience as a home enthusiast and MCA Archivist; however, I welcome collaboration from anyone willing to share their experiences, either at home or in a coffee shop.

I am by no means an expert in freezing coffee: I have researched and learnt from the work of some much better qualified individuals, referenced in this guide. I think there is still much that could be explored in the world of coffee freezing, so if you would like to get in touch to share your own findings, or if you spot any inaccuracies, please drop me an [email](mailto:tom@manchestercoffeearchive.com) or a [DM](https://www.instagram.com/manchestercoffeearchive).

If you find this guide useful, then feel free to show your appreciation by buying me a coffee. I do drink coffee too occasionally.

## Introduction

I started freezing coffee in 2018; my initial aim was to preserve a sample of each coffee so I could taste them all together at a later date, but I later realised that freezing also allowed me to preserve larger portions of coffee so that I always had a good selection available at any time. If I saw a coffee I wanted to try it wouldn’t matter that I already had enough coffee on-the-go, I could just freeze it until I actually needed more coffee. This flexibility totally changed the way I buy coffee for myself, and means I never really waste any at home.

The collection of coffee samples I amassed over time eventually led, through encouragement from the rest of the Archivists, to the formation of Manchester Coffee Archive. Anyone could do the same if they wanted to… but be prepared for a lot of admin and spreadsheets.

It should be noted that coffee does not technically “freeze” (as stated by [Hendon](https://www.thelittleblackcoffeecup.com/journal/cryogenics)) since it is solid at room temperature; “freezing” coffee refers to “cooling of coffee to at least freezer temperatures” and is used as shorthand.



------

## Why freeze coffee?

The benefits of freezing coffee apply to both the home enthusiast and coffee professionals. Some may be more important than others:

- Stop the clock
- Preserve coffee at peak flavour
- Never run out of coffee
- Keep a variety of coffees in stock
- Reduce fear of missing out
- Improved grind consistency

 

### Stop the clock

Freezing allows you to massively reduce the rate at which coffee stales over time, and allows you to preserve the flavour over a very long time period.

 

> *“... for every 10ºC you cool something down, most of the processes occurring in the bean occur at half the rate. So cooling of coffee should prevent chemical reactions that occur over time (like staling or aging), by making them proceed extremely slowly.”*
>
> \-  Christopher Hendon - interview with [The Little Black Coffee Cup](https://www.thelittleblackcoffeecup.com/journal/cryogenics)



The Arrhenius equation can be used to derive the following, as calculated by Michael Cameron:

| Temperature                                 | Equivalent  number of days aging at room temperature (25ºc) |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| -18ºc approximately (domestic freezer)      | 90 days                                                     |
| -30<40ºc approximately (commercial freezer) | 237 days                                                    |

This shows how much the shelf life of coffee can be extended by freezing, and this can be applied at any point. For example, when only taking temperature into account:

- Coffee frozen on **Day 7** past roast will take **2070 days (5 years 8 months approximately)** (23 x 90) to reach the same point in the aging process as the same coffee left at an ambient temperature of 25ºc for 30 days

- Coffee frozen on **Day 25** past roast will take **450 days** (5 x 90) to reach the same point in the aging process as the same coffee left at an ambient temperature of 25ºc for 30 days


This is an oversimplification, but it gives an idea of how long coffee can be preserved with even a normal domestic freezer. Freezing has potentially massive benefits for those wishing to preserve coffee at its peak flavour.

It should be noted, these estimates are only taking storage temperature into account and other variables may have a negative effect on flavour during the storage time. One important consideration is the storage method in the freezer: at some point, coffee stored in a non-airtight bag will most likely not taste as good as coffee stored in a vacuum sealed bag, although the point at which the storage method becomes an issue is not something I have been able to figure out yet.



### Preserve coffee at its peak flavour

Freezing avoids the issue of coffee going stale. If you know you won’t use a full bag within the peak window of flavour, freezing allows you to continue to enjoy the coffee at its optimum taste. For consistency, at MCA we aim to freeze coffee at 7-10 days past roast, which means that when the coffee is used it should taste approximately the same as when it was initially frozen. 

However, finding the optimum time to freeze coffee will depend on the optimum rest period for the specific coffee, and this can vary considerably. Lighter roasts in particular may taste best 2, 3 or more weeks after roast and it is worth considering this when choosing when to freeze a particular coffee. Roasters with a lighter roasting style such as Lüna, La Cabra and Talormade have noted that their coffees can taste good up to 3 months past roast, and the peak flavour may be several weeks past roast. Alexander Mills has written about this in more detail in his [blog](https://alexandermills.ca/blog/light-vs-dark-roast).



### Never run out of coffee

This process can be as simple as freezing half of each bag of coffee you buy at home, or buying two bags instead of one when visiting a coffee shop. Freezing means you can keep as much coffee in stock as you like.

 

### Keep a variety of coffees in stock

Freezing allows you to maintain a wide selection of coffees with minimal effort. If you freeze some of each coffee you buy this allows you to enjoy a range of coffees throughout the year, and revisit coffees you have particularly enjoyed. Since coffee is a seasonal crop, coffees or certain origins are easier to get hold of at different times of year; freezing allows you to avoid this limitation.

 

### Reduce fear of missing out

Freezing makes fear of missing out on limited-run coffees a thing of the past. If a super-fancy coffee becomes available and you already have a few bags on the go then you can buy a bag without having to worry about when you will use it.

 

### Improved grind consistency and distribution

The work of Christopher Hendon at his team, published in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep24483) goes into great detail about the effect of temperature upon grind particle distribution and grind consistency. An [explanation](https://baristahustle.com/blog/the-grinder-paper-explained/) of the findings was posted on Barista Hustle, which makes some recommendations based on the paper. This is a complicated area, and not something I fully understand, but the benefits of grind consistency may be more applicable to espresso. I only brew filter coffee at home so haven’t experienced this benefit myself, but those who use frozen coffee for espresso might be and to advise further on this benefit.

 

### Contribute coffee to MCA

Freezing allows you to keep hold of the coffee sample until you are able to share it with us at one of our events. More information about how to contribute coffee to MCA can be found [here](https://www.cognitoforms.com/ManchesterCoffeeArchive1/ContributeCoffeeToMCA).

## Storage Methods

There are lots of ways to store coffee, in or out of the freezer. It can be difficult to know which method is best, and this will vary depending upon how long the coffee is being stored. Vacuum sealing with plastic bags currently seems to be the best available option for long term freezer storage, which is why we use it to archive coffees for MCA. However, if you want to give freezing a try, there are alternatives as simple as just putting the unopened bag in the freezer - I have explored some of these options below.

There is a surprising amount of debate about the best way to store coffee but to simplify, it is easiest to consider three main factors that affect how quickly coffee will deteriorate:

1. Amount of oxygen in the container
2. Amount of air getting into the container
3. Temperature

Reducing temperature reduces how fast the coffee will age, so the freezer takes care of this one. The other two factors are dependent on the storage container. Freezer air can be damp and potentially odorous so it is important to try and keep this out.



### Vacuum sealing

Air contains roughly 20% oxygen and this can either be removed by sucking the air out displacing it with an inert gas (such as carbon dioxide or argon). Oxygen causes oxidation, and therefore degradation of coffee, and so ideally needs to be removed as much as possible from the coffee storage. Vacuum sealers are a simple way of removing air from a bag of coffee and then sealing with a permanent seal.

 Vacuum sealers vary in their performance, and some will pull a more complete vacuum than others. This is indicated by the kPa rating, which is usually between 70-85kPa for domestic vacuum sealers. When vacuum sealing coffee, the plastic wraps tightly around the beans, reducing the amount of air inside the package; however, air will still remain in the gaps that remain in the package. The amount of oxygen remaining in these gaps depends on the kPa rating of the vacuum sealer, but may be ~80% atmospheric levels: this can be calculated using the formula and conversion table on The Engineering Toolbox ([link](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/vacuum-converter-d_460.html)). More heavy-duty chamber vacuum sealers can pull out closer to a ~99% vacuum but are much more expensive. 

Displacing air with inert gas (flushing) is a technique used to package coffee bags and can be very effective at removing oxygen without the need to create a vacuum inside the bag: however, I haven’t found an easy way to use this technique at home yet. If anyone has developed any easy method to use to repackage small amounts of coffee with inert gas I would love to hear about it!

 Using a vacuum sealer is very popular, but there are alternatives. With each of these options the main factors to consider are:

- How good is the seal?

- How much air is in the container?

- For how long will the coffee be stored?



### Alternatives to Vacuum sealing

- **The original bag** - press out as much air/gas as possible and tape up the valve (electrical tape or duct tape works well) or put it in a ziplock bag. If the bag was previously flushed with inert gas, the coffee will preserve particularly well as there will be even less oxygen in the bag. If there's no valve you can try just putting it straight in the freezer or puncturing the bag to press the air/gas out. This may well be the best option if freezing a whole bag of coffee, particularly if the bag has been flushed with inert gas.

- **Plastic reusable containers** - make sure the lid has a good seal and use one in an appropriate size for the amount you want to freeze. Also be aware that some type of plastic (e.g. PP - polypropylene) become brittle when stored at freezer temperature and may break.

- **Ziplock bags** - bags with a double seal are a good option, available from IKEA and other places. Press out the air, or use a straw to suck out the air if you like, and seal the bag. 

- **Glass bottles** - silicone stoppers can create a good seal.

- **Glass jars** - make sure it has a tight-fitting lid.

- **Tied-up plastic freezer bag** - low cost and takes up very little space. Press out the air and tie it up tightly.

  

These “alternative methods” mean that it may not be necessary to buy a vacuum sealer, especially for shorter term storage, and are low cost options that are available if you want to try freezing some coffee. It would be interesting to know exactly how well these methods perform over time, and I'd like to test these out more to be able to provide better recommendations; however, if you want to preserve coffee for a few months, possibly more, these are all options worth considering.

There are a few storage methods I don’t recommend: reusable ziplock bags with valves are appealing but I have found that air tends to leak back into these quickly, particularly after being reused. Ryan Woodgate has mentioned having similar experiences with them. Similarly, rigid plastic containers or bottles with vacuum valves have similar issues: the partial vacuum inside the container is essentially trying to suck air in all the time so any imperfections in the seal will cause air to be leaked back into the container. Also, Fellow do not recommend using their Atmos Vacuum Canisters in a freezer due to negative effects on the seal. 



### What we use at Manchester Coffee Archive

- Aicok Vacuum Sealer - [£39.99 via Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Aicok-Automatic-One-Touch-Sealing-Packing/dp/B06XR5RZ83)

- 12cm and 15cm wide rolls of vacuum sealing plastic - embossed/textured plastic suitable for domestic vacuum sealers (various prices on eBay/Amazon)
- Permanent marker - to label the bags

- Chest freezer (only used for coffee)


I tend to buy unbranded 12cm and 15cm wide rolls of vacuum sealing plastic from eBay sellers, normally buying 5 rolls at a time. Local and online availability may vary depending on where you are located, but search “12/15cm vacuum roll” and you should see a few options.

Alternatively, individual bags can be purchased, such as the 10x15cm Fresherpack bags found on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.co.uk/10cm-15cm-Vacuum-Sealer-Embossed/dp/B015A7PHDM); however, these can potentially work out more expensively. For small portions I have found that prepared bags from a roll were roughly a third of the cost of individual bags when buying 100.

## Vacuum-sealing Workflow Examples

There are two main options when using vacuum-sealed plastic bags:

- Vacuum-sealing and resealing bags

- Single-dose bags




### Vacuum-sealing and resealing with vacuum bags

This is a good method to use if you just want to make one or two cups of coffee at a time and this is therefore what I do with most coffees at home. This method is great for particularly fancy, expensive coffees that you want to hang on to for a while. 

 Most domestic vacuum sealers require **embossed/textured** plastic and will not work with smooth bags. Make sure the plastic roll/bags you buy are suitable before you buy in bulk.

 With a larger bag, you can cut out the original packaging label and put it inside, but I tend to just hold on to these and record all the information on a spreadsheet so I know exactly what I have in the freezer.

 

#### Method

1. Coffee is portioned into a prepared bag (cut from a 12cm or 15cm wide roll); I have found 20cm x15cm wide bags work well for 100g portions as it allows the bag to be flattened.

2. If only removing 12-15g portion at a time a 12cm wide bag may be more appropriate since the empty section after removing this amount may not be sufficient to reseal (in which case you will need either remove more coffee or re-bag the whole lot)

3. Remove the package from the freezer, cut a small incision just before the seal so I can portion out the dose (usually 12<15g) and immediately reseal the bag and return to the freezer. I reseal and freeze at this point to avoid storing the beans at room temperature as much as possible, and it is good to get it out of the way. 

4. Grind the coffee frozen and brew.




#### Notes

With my vacuum sealer, I need to seal approximately 1<2 cm of the bag each time I open it, due to the gap between the vacuum chamber and the heat sealer. When using a 12cm of 15cm roll a 14 dose of coffee and be removed, and the bag re-sealed; however, with a wider roll/bag removing such a small amount may not allow for the vacuum sealer the close, so more coffee will need to be removed.

As I work my way through the bag I end up with 1<2 cm strips of plastic as each re-seal point. 

Using this method means the bag itself cannot be reused as it is cut up, but removing entire bags from the freezer could allow the bags to be reused.

*Resealing an opened bag: the cut edge is just inside the vacuum chamber. The bag reduces in length by 1.5cm approx between resealing (indicated by arrows on the right)*

*This 100g bag has been re-sealed twice - the seal points show the minimum cut-down amount for each re-seal with my Crenova vacuum sealer (1<2cm) - the maximum size of the storage section is preserved and could potentially be reused as a small sample bag once the empty (depending on how much is left)*

 

#### Single-dose bags

This is what we do for all the coffees contributed to MCA for tasting events throughout the year. The same process could be used for preparing single-dose bags for espresso or filter coffee.

 

- 13g/26g portions of coffee in 10.5cmx12cm prepared bags (cut from a 12cm roll of vacuum sealing plastic)
- Frozen at around 10 days past roast, where possible.

- Labelled with freeze dates, plus basic information about the coffee (the rest is on a spreadsheet)

- Since the coffees are transported offsite, we decant the required amount into a small container and re-seal and freeze the remaining coffee.

## Grinding from frozen

If you want to use coffee stored in the freezer, there is no need to let it defrost: you can use it straight away. Frozen coffee beans have been found to produce a narrower spread of particle and a finer grind size, so you may need to adjust your grinder to a coarser setting depending on how you are making coffee.

 Todd Souter mentions this in his [guide](https://www.instagram.com/p/Byc3eztBWhY/?igshid=1me8e5orm93qe) to using frozen coffee beans: he suggests a setting 2-notches coarser on an EK43 for espresso. This adjustment will vary depending on grinder though, so it is worth testing it out and making a note of the adjustment needed. 

 Other brew methods, such as v60 or Aeropress, are more forgiving to grind-size so there may not be any noticeable difference when using the same setting used for room temperature. It might be worth trying a slightly coarser setting too though, if only to compare any difference in taste.

  

------



## Removing coffee from the freezer and using at room temperature

Allowing the coffee to come to room temperature (e.g. if using the coffee over the course of a day/week) means the potential benefits of grinding from frozen are lost, but this may be more practical if you know you will be using the coffee over a relatively short period of time. Mat North (Raw Material) and others have noticed that coffee seems to age faster when removed from the freezer, so I'd recommend only taking out what you will use in the next day or so. I'm not sure what would cause this accelerated aging: it could be due to the vacuuming process (if used) or the temperature change itself, but I'd be interested to hear of any experiments that have been done to investigate this.

Originally I was under the impression that a package of coffee removed from the freezer should be allowed to reach room temperature before opening the package and storing at room temperature for any length of time due to concerns over condensation forming on the beans and accelerating oxidation; however, as mentioned above, from speaking to Michael Cameron about this concern and doing my own tests it doesn’t seem to be an issue: condensation forms on the packing packaging but not on the beans themselves.

## Freezing in Reusable Containers

Use of reusable, vacuum valved containers for coffee storage in the freezer is promising but not without its problems. It has the benefit of reducing plastic waste, but it is important to note that the effectiveness of this storage will be dependent on how well the seal maintains the vacuum within the container over time.

 

### Reusable containers for freezing multiple single doses

The [method](https://medium.com/e/down-the-vacuum-sealing-rabbit-hole-7b431141240) used by Aaron Clark at Botany Coffee is a good solution for cafes that avoids the use of disposable plastic. A vacuum degassing chamber and small glass jars are used to freeze individual doses of coffee. Aaron Clark has stated that the vacuum appears to be maintained for around **3 months** using this method, which could therefore be viewed as an appropriate timeframe to used this storage method:

 

> *"Coffees in a freezer for longer than 3 months tend to lose their seal. The biggest indicator is that there is less resistance to the lid opening when the seal is compromised. Our freezers only go to -25C generally and are opened frequently hourly. I imagine that could affect the longevity of the seal"*
>
> \-  Aaron Clark - 12/5/2019

### Pressurising with inert gas:

Matt Perger has suggested reusable valved containers, pressurised with inert gas as a potential alternative to vacuum sealed plastic in discussions on his [Telegram Channel](https://t.me/s/pergfect). This sounds very promising...

------



## Guidance Notes

 

### “Refreezing” Coffee

This has long thought to have a negative impact on coffee, but current advice is that refreezing of roasted coffee does not appear to have any significant negative effects. Michael Cameron has advised this is not something to worry about:



>  *“this ain’t chicken, you can re-freeze”*
>
>  \-  Michael Cameron - [Freeze Beans not Peas](https://strivefortone.com/2017/01/03/freeze-beans-not-peas/)

 

MCA conducted an [experiment](https://www.instagram.com/p/B2Tw5zcBtnI/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link) to determine if there was any difference in flavour between coffee that had been frozen once, and coffee that had been frozen and defrosted seven times. Two cups of the single-frozen coffee and one cup of the refrozen coffee were prepared and participants were asked to pick the odd one out. There was no trend towards picking the refrozen coffee as the odd one out, which suggests there was no noticeable difference in flavour.⁠ This suggests that refreezing may not something to worry about. 

 One issue to point out though: while refreezing seems like it may be fine, *resealing* may have some negative effects on the coffee. Matt Perger has suggested that vacuum sealed coffee stales quickly if re-vacuumed, essentially acting as a “sponge” for oxygen being sucked back into the container. Whether or not this is counteracted by the freezing process is something that needs more investigation.

 

### The “best” time to freeze roasted coffee

Since freezing essentially stops the clock: freezing at the time the coffee tastes best appears to be the best option. If the coffee is 30 days past roast, freezing still seems worth doing to preserve the remaining freshness as long as possible. At MCA we freeze on day 7 for consistency when possible.



> *"There’s a bunch of literature on degassing effects, and how to test it, but so much is dependent on a) the bean and b) how it was roasted. 7-10 days is the window for \*most\* coffees being fully degassed. I wait 9 days, in a temp controlled environment, bag open, then vac seal and freeze"*
>
> \-  Michael Cameron



### How long after vacuum sealing coffee in plastic should the coffee be frozen?

It is recommended to freeze coffee as soon as possible after vacuum sealing. This is based on advice from Angus Mackie (of Ona Coffee), who has suggested that the vacuum-sealed environment can potentially have a negative effect on the coffee:

 

>  *“When coffee is still 'awake' and ageing, having in a vacuumed environment is not healthy”*
>
>  \-  Angus Mackie

 

Todd Souter recommends freezing coffee within 10 minutes of vacuum sealing, stating that the natural carbon dioxide inside the bag can result in a “'choked' or bitter, savoury flavour”. This raises an interesting issue: whether or not coffee stored in an airtight/sealed environment degrades in quality at a more rapid rate than coffee stored in a traditional one-way valve bag. [Research](https://agoodkeensavage.wordpress.com/2012/01/17/why-i-stopped-packaging-our-coffee-in-one-way-valves/) originally circulated by Colonna in reference to their decision to remove valves from their packaging suggests that the addition of a valve does not have a positive impact upon preserving flavour. If roasted coffee is stored vacuum-sealed at room temperature for an extended period (e.g. a couple of days) gas may be released from the coffee (degassing/oxidisation) causing the packaging to loosen. Even if the potential effect upon flavour isn’t a concern, this can make the bag more vulnerable to tearing. 

 

This is an area that I'd like to gather more data on; however, for now the system I am following is to only vacuum seal when I am ready to put coffee in the freezer. *[See Appendix II for more information]*

## Reuse/Recycling:

 

### Plastic vacuum sealing bags

These can be reused: either wipe the bags out with a bit of kitchen roll, or clean them out with water and detergent, but make sure they are fully dried before using again. 

The bag will need to be cut down when reusing, so larger bags have more potential for reuse but will inevitably get smaller as they are re-used. Waste could be minimised by collecting a few smaller, re-used bags in one larger ziplock bag to keep them all together.

Vacuum sealing bags appear to be mostly comprised of PA and PA/PE plastic: the recycling options for this vary on location.

 Vacuum sealing bags seem to be mostly PA and PA/PE plastic:

- PA - polyamide (nylon)

- PE - polyethylene




### Recycling options for PA/PE plastic

[1914 Coffee Company ](https://www.instagram.com/1914coffeecompany/)have advised that vacuum sealer plastic can be recycled in “soft plastic” collections in Canada.

Manchester City Council collection does not recycle PA or PA/PE plastic and this is also the case with at least the majority of other councils in the UK. MCC has also stated that they do not believe these types of plastic are suitable for plastic shopping bag collections seen at supermarkets. At present there does not seem to be a good, local solution in Manchester.

It’s also worth noting that "compostable packaging" (often used for coffee bags) may also not be suitable for green waste collection, so it is always worth checking with local guidelines.

 

### Biodegradable Vacuum sealing bags

Biodegradable vacuum sealing plastic is available, although I have not tried it myself. One example is [Eco Pouch](https://www.thevacuumpouch.co.uk/shop/vacuum-pouches-packaging-bags/biodegradable-vacuum-pouch/eco-pouch-300x300mm-biodegradable-vacuum-pouches/), produced by The Vacuum Pouch Company, based in Bury, UK. Thanks to Ryan Woodgate for the suggestion.

 The guidance is that these bags are not suitable for storing liquid, and can be used for up to one year. Unfortunately the manufacturers have stated that Eco Pouch is not suitable for most domestic vacuum sealers, and requires a "snorkel" part which is inserted into the bag when vacuum sealing.

## Appendix I - Experiments MCA would like to complete and further areas of research

 

### Experiments we would like to do (in order of preference):

- Freezer storage: vacuum-sealed plastic vs. sealed plastic

- Room temperature: vacuum-sealed plastic vs. sealed plastic

- Vacuum sealed frozen coffee portion, removed from the freezer to be transported at room temperature: keeping in original vac-sealed packaging vs. re-sealing without vacuum

- Portion of vacuum sealed frozen coffee removed from larger package to be transported at room temperature: vacuum-sealed plastic vs. sealed plastic

- Portion of vacuum sealed frozen coffee removed from larger package to be transported at room temperature: flushing with inert gas vs. sealed plastic

- Comparing reusable frozen storage containers with vacuum sealed bags over time - at what point is the difference noticeable?

- Comparing room temperature storage methods - at what point is the difference noticeable?

- Investigate the use of oxygen scavenger sachets, silica sachets, carbon dioxide flush and nitrogen flush methods

- How well do biodegradable plastic vacuum bags perform in a freezer? How long do they last before the seals fail?

- Using inert gas and removal of only headspace in sealed packages.




### Areas for investigation

- If a coffee is frozen on day 0 or day 7 for example, will it continue to age at the same rate after being defrosted? e.g. Would a coffee frozen on day 7 and defrosted then left at room temperature for 2 weeks taste as good as a coffee aged normally for 3 weeks?

- Similarly, in order to facilitate a long-distance trade (thinking 7<10 day postal delivery) from several local sources, could a number of coffees be frozen on Day 0, saved up until a collection had been built, and then all removed from the freezer at the same day and be sent thawed? Would this effectively deliver all samples at approximately 7<10 day past roast performance? If coffees prepared in this way were received at MCA we would freeze the coffee again upon receipt so this raised the issue of re-freezing effects again...

- Are freeze temps below -16 necessary for preserving coffee? Or are v low temps only beneficial for grind consistency?

- Is cleaning out vac seal bags practical and effective? Does it need to not have any previous coffee odour at all? Also applies to normal coffee packaging, how clean does it need to be? Drying both of these seems tricky… (applies to reuse of coffee packaging in general but particularly relevant here since single use plastic is quite prevalent in coffee freezing)

## Appendix II - The effects of storing roasting coffee in a sealed and/or vacuum sealed container at ambient temperature:

 Angus Mackie has provided some very interesting information on this topic, and this is an area that would appear to not be fully agreed within the coffee community. While I do not fully understand this area, I am currently only vacuum sealing coffee until ready to freeze and not sorting it vacuum sealed at room temperature.

 Angus in reference to sealed packaging:

> *"Have been tasting same coffee packaged in vac sealed bags (not frozen) vs valved bags. Also with storage containers such as Illy tin vs valved bag. And coffee that is still quite young in air scape containers vs bags. And found quite similar patterns with how coffees tasted. **When in a completely sealed environment at room temp, coffee had less sweetness, noticeably higher dryness, and quite a consistent savoury flavour that was not in those coffees in the 'regular' packaged environment**"*

 Angus in reference to the [article](https://agoodkeensavage.wordpress.com/2012/01/17/why-i-stopped-packaging-our-coffee-in-one-way-valves/) by agoodcleansavage re: sealed packaging:

> *"This conclusion is a result of many different experiments, involving different coffees, roast approach, ages and times in these environments. And one of the big consistencies was pattern of taste. Reading this **article** does make me curious. I would not like to rule out what they say so my first main query is did they have good results vacuuming their coffee straight after roast. As in my testing, vacuuming or packaging into air tight/no valve environments, the range of times after roast I've done have been between 22 hours after roast and intermittently between 5-30 days after roast. Anytime when this happened, and **anytime coffee was taken from a valved environment into a completely sealed environment between 5-30 days, or straight into vacuuming and not freezing, similar taste degradation occurred"***

## Appendix III - Correspondence from Manchester City Council

> *“The collection points in some supermarkets for plastic bags are only for polythene packaging like salad bags and bread bags etc. I’m not aware of any recycling facility for household PA. In Greater Manchester, the only type of plastic that can be recycled in the recycling bins at home is plastic bottles (all types including HDPE, PET and PVC).*
>
>  *Business waste is dealt with separately. Business must pay for the disposal and recycling of their waste and can approach any waste collection contractor such as Viridor, Biffa, Suez, Veolia, Cleanaway etc, they will all have their own plastic recycling collections and they will vary depending on the recycling processor that they take the material to.*
>
>  *In terms of PA, it’s not really down to guidance, it’s about whether there are any facilities that are capable of recycling the PA and whether there’s enough PA to make it economically feasible to develop the technology to recycle it. Any plastic that can’t be recycled will generally be sent to an Energy from waste facility and used to generate electricity.*
