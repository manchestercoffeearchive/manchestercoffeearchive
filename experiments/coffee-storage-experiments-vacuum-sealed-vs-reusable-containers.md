## Introduction

### Aim

To determine if there is any perceptible difference in flavour between vacuum sealed coffee and coffee stored in a similarly sized, sealed container, where both are stored in a freezer for a period of 6 months. The eventual aim is to determine if reusable containers can be used as an alternative to vacuum-sealing for storing coffee in a freezer for long periods of time.

 Note: the experiment method can be easily adapted to test another variable in coffee storage, by changing how Coffee A and B are defined.



### Background

Optimal storage of roasted coffee is subject to a great deal of opinion and debate. At MCA we want to find the best ways to preserve the flavour of roasted coffee, both in and out of the freezer. There are many storage variables we would like to test (examples can be found in Appendix II), but first we want to focus on comparing reusable containers to vacuum sealed bags.

 It should be noted that vacuum sealers vary in their performance, and some will pull a more complete vacuum than others. This is indicated by the kPa rating, which is usually between 70-85kPa for domestic vacuum sealers. When vacuum sealing coffee, the plastic wraps tightly around the beans, reducing the amount of air inside the package; however, air will still remain in the gaps that remain in the package and the gap size will also depend on the shape and orientation of the beans. The amount of oxygen remaining in the gaps depends on the kPa rating of the vacuum sealer, but may be ~80% atmospheric levels: this can be calculated using the formula and conversion table on The Engineering Toolbox ([link](https://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/vacuum-converter-d_460.html)).



### Methodology

There are two methods that may be used to compare coffee samples:

- Triangle tests: picking the odd-one-out (the “intruder coffee”) from three samples;
- Assigning scores to each coffee sample and  comparing these scores.

 Triangle tests may be the easiest to participate in and the results directly address the issue being investigated. 

Scoring each coffee sample using a system such as the SCA score sheet allows for a large amount of data to be gathered but may be difficult for those not used to assessing coffees in such an in-depth way. For our tests we decided to use triangle tests.

Repetition will help to determine if any perceived taste differences are significant. As an estimate: if 6 triangle tests are prepared, I might expect someone to correctly identify the intruder coffee 2/6 times on average. 

The usual cup-to-cup variation in flavour, experienced when brewing the sample coffee several times with no difference in preparation, is an important issue that could affect the results. I may also expect some of the control sample coffee samples to taste noticeably different due to normal cup-to-cup variation. If the usual cup-to-cup variation in a coffee is greater than the variation caused by the storage method itself, then the effects of the storage method could be described as negligible.

Tasting fatigue is also an important issue: from small scale tests we have found that after 5 triangle tests it becomes even more difficult to decide upon the intruder coffee. A total number of 6 triangle tests has been selected as a middle ground for each tasting, but repeated over 3 consecutive days for a total of 18 triangle tests More experienced tasters may find they are able to complete the experiment with more cups in one sitting without suffering from tasting fatigue, in which case the method included below can be adapted to suit.

Deciding upon the number of participants to involve is an important decision for the experiment. In order to avoid complicating the data too much, I have designed the experiment to only have one taster, but it can be repeated with multiple people to gather more data. Having only one taster at a time allows for a calm environment with allowing for better concentration and may help reduce bias. The experimenter can be included in the tasting if you like, with an extra blinding step as detailed in the method.
