 ## Aim

This is an attempt to collate all the currently available information on the topic of “freezing” roasted coffee in order to preserve it for long periods of time. Freezing is the driving force being MCA so it has therefore been crucial that we look into best practices.

I will focus on my own experience as a home enthusiast and MCA Archivist; however, I welcome collaboration from anyone willing to share their experiences, either at home or in a coffee shop.

I am by no means an expert in freezing coffee: I have researched and learnt from the work of some much better qualified individuals, referenced in this guide. I think there is still much that could be explored in the world of coffee freezing, so if you would like to get in touch to share your own findings, or if you spot any inaccuracies, please drop me an [email](mailto:tom@manchestercoffeearchive.com) or a [DM](https://www.instagram.com/manchestercoffeearchive).

If you find this guide useful, then feel free to show your appreciation by buying me a coffee. I do drink coffee too occasionally.

## Introduction

I started freezing coffee in 2018; my initial aim was to preserve a sample of each coffee so I could taste them all together at a later date, but I later realised that freezing also allowed me to preserve larger portions of coffee so that I always had a good selection available at any time. If I saw a coffee I wanted to try it wouldn’t matter that I already had enough coffee on-the-go, I could just freeze it until I actually needed more coffee. This flexibility totally changed the way I buy coffee for myself, and means I never really waste any at home.

The collection of coffee samples I amassed over time eventually led, through encouragement from the rest of the Archivists, to the formation of Manchester Coffee Archive. Anyone could do the same if they wanted to… but be prepared for a lot of admin and spreadsheets.

It should be noted that coffee does not technically “freeze” [[1]](#1) since it is solid at room temperature; “freezing” coffee refers to “cooling of coffee to at least freezer temperatures” and is used as shorthand.



## Storage Containers and Equipment

There are lots of ways to store coffee, in or out of the freezer. It can be difficult to know which method is best, and this will vary depending upon how long the coffee is being stored. Vacuum sealing with plastic bags currently seems to be the best available option for long term freezer storage, which is why we use it to archive coffees for MCA. However, if you want to give freezing a try, there are alternatives as simple as just putting the unopened bag in the freezer - I have explored some of these options below.

There is a surprising amount of debate about the best way to store coffee but to simplify, it is easiest to consider three main factors that affect how quickly coffee will deteriorate:

1. Amount of oxygen in the container
2. Amount of air getting into the container
3. Temperature

 Reducing temperature reduces how fast the coffee will age, so the freezer takes care of this one. The other two factors are dependent on the storage container. Freezer air can be damp and potentially odorous so it is important to try and keep this out.

 Air contains roughly 20% oxygen and this can either be removed by sucking the air out displacing it with an inert gas (such as carbon dioxide or argon). Oxygen causes oxidation, and therefore degradation of coffee, and so ideally needs to be removed as much as possible from the coffee storage. Vacuum sealers are a simple way of removing air from a bag of coffee and then sealing with a permanent seal.

 Vacuum sealers vary in their performance, and some will pull a more complete vacuum than others. This is indicated by the kPa rating, which is usually between 70-85kPa for domestic vacuum sealers. When vacuum sealing coffee, the plastic wraps tightly around the beans, reducing the amount of air inside the package; however, air will still remain in the gaps that remain in the package. The amount of oxygen remaining in these gaps depends on the kPa rating of the vacuum sealer, but may be ~80% atmospheric levels [[2]](#2).  More heavy-duty chamber vacuum sealers can pull out closer to a ~99% vacuum but are much more expensive. 

 Displacing air with inert gas (flushing) is a technique used to package coffee bags and can be very effective at removing oxygen without the need to create a vacuum inside the bag: however, I haven’t found an easy way to use this technique at home yet. If anyone has developed any easy method to use to repackage small amounts of coffee with inert gas I would love to hear about it!

 Using a vacuum sealer is very popular, but there are alternatives. With each of these options the main factors to consider are:

●   How good is the seal?

●   How much air is in the container?

●   For how long will the coffee be stored?

 Here are a few examples:

●   **The original bag** - press out as much air/gas as possible and tape up the valve (electrical tape or duct tape works well) or put it in a ziplock bag. If the bag was previously flushed with inert gas, the coffee will preserve particularly well as there will be even less oxygen in the bag. If there's no valve you can try just putting it straight in the freezer or puncturing the bag to press the air/gas out. This may well be the best option if freezing a whole bag of coffee, particularly if the bag has been flushed with inert gas.

●   **Plastic reusable containers** - make sure the lid has a good seal and use one in an appropriate size for the amount you want to freeze. Also be aware that some type of plastic (e.g. PP - polypropylene) become brittle when stored at freezer temperature and may break.
